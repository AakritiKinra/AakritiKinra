I’m Aakriti Kinra, a recent **Master’s in Computational Data Science** graduate from **Carnegie Mellon University’s School of Computer Science**. My passions revolve around building scalable AI systems 🚀 — everything from designing deep learning models 🤖 to orchestrating cloud-based deployments. I love diving into multimodal ML, LLM analysis, and MLOps, bridging cutting-edge research with real-world applications.

I’m now looking for **full-time roles** where I can apply my skillset in **data science**, **machine learning**, and **AI**. If you’re interested in collaborating on new ideas or just want to chat about the latest in AI, feel free to explore my repositories and connect! Let’s build something impactful together 🤝.
